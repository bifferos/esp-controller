arduino-sketch
==============

Simple program running on ESP-01 to query a value
on a remote server via UDP.

Would have used CoAP but it's too complicated (at least
with go and I wanted low resource usage).


device-service
==============

Transmit the presence or absense of files back to the
UDP client.
